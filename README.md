# TLM-Models-For-Railway-Vibrations

Thin-Layer Model (TLM) of vibrations induced by rail is shown in this repo. The track structure is modelled by 2.5 Finite Elements
and the subgrade is modelled using TLM. The coupling is done by considering all degrees of freedom.

A simple validation is given to show the robustness of the model.
